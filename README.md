# VexRobotCode
This is the code our team used for the VEX 2021-2022 Season, "Tipping point". Although I may have started with next to no experience with C++, I did learn quite a lot about what it had to offer, working with multiple files, as well as working with the different VEX sensors and actuators that were available to our team.

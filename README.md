# VexRobotCode
This is the code our team used for the VEX 2021-2022 Season, "Tipping point". Although I may have started with next to no experience with C++, I did learn quite a lot about what it had to offer, working with multiple files, as well as working with the different VEX sensors and actuators that were available to our team.

### Using the code
If you'd like to open it please do so in VEXcode V5 as that's what the files were designed for! simply drag the .v5code into the editor and it should open up!
